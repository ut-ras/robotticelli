Each directory has its own README file for more specific information.
The high level overview of this project is that, when software is run,
a web application listens on port a port specified in the conf file. When an image is submitted to
this program it executes functions that process the image and writes
a tsv file to hardware/robot/image.tsv, that will be parsed to physically
draw the image.
